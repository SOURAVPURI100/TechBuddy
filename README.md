What it does
It is basically an Android application which has multiple views for a user. We are defining the functionality of this application in below steps.

Sign Up and Login Area. First of all, user can sign up for the application and after that he/she can login to go to main Dashboard area.
Dashboard Area: Dashboard area is the main screen which user will see when he/she will login into the application. Dashboard area will contain a card list view of all the posts of requirements that other users have posted using their application. So User can basically see the other people's posts and if he/she can send a request to connect with that person if they are interested.
Create a Post: User can create a new post to look for partners which all other users can see through our server. To create a post, user will fill up some basic information such as what his/her project is about and what skills he/she is looking in a potential match.
Profile View: User can see other people's profiles if they are public by the owner.
Notification: If user has a notification from some potential match, then he/she will be notified.
Note: - Our application is not entirely complete but we have build major parts for our application.
